Waratahs at near full strength for Fiji trial

   Waratahs coach Chris Hickey will ensure that every available squad
   member will receive 40-60 minutes of trial Rugby this weekend following
   the announcement of Friday's team to take on the Fiji Warriors at the
   Sydney Football Stadium.

   Hickey has named a 28-man squad to take on the Pacific Islanders which
   includes 13 internationals and seven players returning from the Spring
   Tour.

   In addition, Daniel Halangahu, Damien Fitzpatrick, Jeremy Tilse, Pat
   O'Connor and Brendan McKibbin have been made available for selection to
   the Australian Barbarians for their clash with the Western Force at
   T.G. Millner Field on Sunday.

   "We always knew we wanted everyone who is available to play in the
   first trial, however the unfortunate flipside to that is you're not in
   the best situation to give everyone the game time they need," said
   Hickey.

   "With the Australian Barbarians match on Saturday it enables a number
   of those players pushing for places in the 22 to get a good amount of
   game time which is better for them than getting just 20 minutes at the
   end."

   The Tahs have named a strong team which will see Lachie Turner trialled
   in the No.13 jersey while Tom Carter and Ryan Cross will both have
   opportunities to impress at inside centre. Afa Pakalani, recruited from
   Auckland in the off-season, will partner Kurtley Beale and Drew
   Mitchell in the back three.

   Ben Mowen will start the match on the side of the scrum while Dave
   Dennis will get his opportunity as the game progresses, and Wycliff
   Palu makes his return almost ten months after suffering a severe knee
   injury against the Crusaders.

   Sekope Kepu gets the first chance in the No.1 jersey with Benn Robinson
   sitting out the match after suffering a slight calf strain.

   "We'll be doing our best to ensure over both trials that everyone in
   contention for the opening round gets the game time they need to be fit
   for the first match, and that they also have the chance to push their
   claims for selection," said Hickey.

   "There's a lot of established players in this squad but at the end of
   the day form is what counts and we need the players playing the best
   football on the park when we head to Melbourne in two weeks time."

   Cam Jowitt (foot) and Locky McCaffrey (leg/ankle) are both on a
   long-term recovery from injury while Rob Horne (elbow), Brackin
   Karauria-Henry (back) and Pat McCutcheon (back) are all hoping for game
   time before round one.
