Lions off got a good start with Sharks victory

   The Lions started the new season off on a high scoring an empathic
   41-10 victory over the Sharks in a Neo Africa Tri Series match on
   Tuesday night.

   The Johannesburg squad ran in six tries to one, with five of them
   coming in the second half of the match.

   It was slightly ironic that on the same day the Lions announced the
   signing of Butch James, fellow fly-half Burton Francis was one of the
   standout performers for the Lions.

   The Sharks were first to put points on the board when Patrick Lambie
   dived over for the first try of the match, but still the quality of
   rugby played in the early stages of the match did not impress the 3 000
   odd spectators.

   Lions fly-half Andre Pretorius eventually opened the team's tally with
   a penalty and just before the siren flank Derick Mini ensured the
   Johannesburg side took the lead, shoved over the line by his pack.

   Unlike the first 40 minutes, the second half provided great
   entertainment with the Lions, playing with a real sense of urgency and
   was rewarded for their efforts when eighth-man Warren Whitely dotted
   down as a result of impressive handling skills by his team mates.

   Burton Francis nailed the conversion to give his side a 17-5 lead from
   where they could play with more confidence.

   That confidence resulted in the Lions' third try of the evening.

   This time fullback Jaco Taute chipped the ball through the Sharks
   backline and followed up to make it 22-5.

   Francis was rock solid with his conversion and it became clear that the
   match was slipping away from the Currie Cup champions.

   Eventually Springbok newcomer Lwazi Mvovo managed to restore some pride
   for the Sharks with a textbook finish, but the Lions pack needed only
   crack at the opposition's line to wipe out the gain that had Mvovo
   made.

   In what would have been a bonus point try in Super Rugby terms for the
   Lions, skipper Franco van der Merwe emerged with ball-in-hand and his
   pack duly forced him over the line.

   And just to add salt in the Sharks' wounds replacements Caylib
   Oosthuizen and Michael Killian added two more tries to the embarrassing
   score line.

   Final score Sharks 10 (5) Lions 41 (10)
