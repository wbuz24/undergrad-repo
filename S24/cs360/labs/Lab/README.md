# Dobbie The House Elf

Your name is Dobbie, you are a house elf with the goal to break your dear friend Harry Podder from the wicked clutches of the Dursliey Family. Your goal is to find the fastest route to Hogwards, while avoiding the Malvoy Mansion and the eerie Mr. Malvoy. Unfortunately for you, as all things in this modern word, it costs coin to enter a residence, while you and your friend Harry only have a collective 250 coin (you are have no coin). As an added challenge, you only know your location once entering.

Luckily for you, Dobbie comes standard with House Elf Tools and Powers, mainly:
 - Teleportation between known locations.
 - An ePhone with a GPS that shows all reachable locations from your current position and their respective cost for entering.
 - A brain that acts shockingly similar to the C programming language.

Find the cheapest path from the Dursliers, to Hogwards. If you enter a residence and find that you have fallen back in the clutches of the Durslieys, the Malvoys, or run out of coin, you are then trapped where you are and have failed to get Harry to Hogwards.
