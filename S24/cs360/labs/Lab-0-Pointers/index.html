Lab Zero.  HTML file for key wbuziak:
<p>
For these questions, I have declared:
<pre>
  unsigned char *cp;
  unsigned int *ip;
  unsigned int x, y;
  unsigned char w, z;
</pre>
Assume that you are running on a little-endian machine with 4-byte pointers.
<p>
In the following questions, give me the exact output of the <b>printf()</b> statements,
assuming that <b>cp</b> and <b>ip</b> both equal <tt>0x55f23130</tt>.
</td><td width=200 valign=top>
The 12 integers starting at address <tt>0x55f23130</tt> are:
