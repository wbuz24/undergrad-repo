## Printing in the lab
 - Updated 10/6/2023

The TENNLab(MK338) has two 3D printers. The smaller being the Ultimaker3 and the larger being the Type A Machines: Series Pro 1. This document will largely focus on the Series Pro 1 printing protocol. 


# Series Pro 1 -- Type A Machines

This printer takes 1.75mm PLA filament.
 - The TENNLab has filament labeled in bins underneath the printer.
 - Fresh filament should be used, otherwise it may become brittle and risk breaking in the printing nozzle.
 - Ensure the filament will stick to the print bed by applying Elmer's glue sticks to the print bed just before initiating your print.

After generating your gcode file, you can upload it directly to the machine through this link, which can only be accessed from the UT network. [http://mk338-3dp.eecs.utk.edu:5000/](http://mk338-3dp.eecs.utk.edu:5000/)

 
# Removing broken filament from the nozzle

Sometimes broken filament is stuck in the printing nozzle. This will block more filament to push into the nozzle and onto your printing part. 

To fix this, stop the print and find an iFixIt kit (there should be one in the lab). Use a small screwdriver to remove the singular bolt on the printing face just above the fan. From there, you can use some tweezers to remove the broken filament, screw the plate back on and test. 

It is recommended to restart your print if this happens as the nozzle can move during this process.

# Cleaning the print bed 

 The print bed must be cleaned every once in a while. Elmer's glue sticks are water soluble and the print bed is removable.
 - Ensure you first unplug the print bed 
 - Perhaps
