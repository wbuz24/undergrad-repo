# B Tree
B Tree is colloquially known as the most difficult lab offered in the computer science major at UTK - or atleast given by my professor (Dr. Plank)[https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/]

The tree is implemented on a "jdisk" this is nothing more than an interface written to imitate disks. Think implementing a data structure that abuses the format of disk sectors to organize and store your data.
