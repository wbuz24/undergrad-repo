# Jgraph lab
This lab was rather open ended, generate a jgraph that is "visually interesting".

I decided to do mine on my Professor, (Dr. Plank)[https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/]'s infamous "Music of The Day". It was my hope that I could create a visual represntation of Dr. Plank's music taste. He often includes a description with a date, whether it be when the music piece was released, or the decade the artist was most active.

The format is inconsistent and largely written in stream-of-thought text. Therefore, to achieve my goal, I had to parse the entire file and write a rather smart program to find the dates and throw out all the extraneous details, numbers and irrelevant dates.
