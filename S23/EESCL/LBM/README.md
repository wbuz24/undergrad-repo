# Python LBM code

I wrote these python programs from scratch with the help of the PhD student I worked for in the EESCL, Anirban Roy.

The intention of these programs is to learn the Lattice Boltzmann method of simulating fluid flow in a few begineer scenarios. Beginning with simple pouiseulle flow through a pipe to flow around a cylinder.
