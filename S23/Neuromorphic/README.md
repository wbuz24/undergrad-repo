# Neuromorphic Computing Undergraduate Research

During the Spring 2023 semester, I began working with the [TENNLab](https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/) as an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. James Plank

I primarily used this semester to familiarize myself with the framework and began writing a C++ application that sought to mimic the CrazyFlie drone senior design project in a 2-D scroller type of environment.
 - The purpose of this exercise was initially to learn the intricacies of how the framework interacts with the control applications, however evolved into interest to be used as an app to be run on the Izhikevich processor.

It was in this semester that I began working with Thomas Neuefeind on the Izhikevich processor.
