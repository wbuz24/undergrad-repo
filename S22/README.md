# Spring 2022

This semester was the second semester of my junior year in mechanical engineering. In this semester, I decided to start taking computer science classes on the side. I also acquired an internship at Shaw Industries for process engineering in the following summer. Additionally, I was accepted to begin researching with the EESCL upon returning the following fall semester.
