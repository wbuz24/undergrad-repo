# Will Buziak's Undergraduate Repository
This repository holds the course work for Will Buziak's Undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

## Note:

- This repo is broken down by semester, ex: "F22" is "Fall 2022" semester.

- The repo begins in Fall 2021 (Junior year), as I got a new laptop and lost the files from my freshman and sophomore years.
