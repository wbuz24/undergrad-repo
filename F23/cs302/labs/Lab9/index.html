<h3>What you are to submit</h3>

You are to submit the file <b>worddice.cpp</b>.  This should be a standalone C++ file that the
TA's will compile and test with the gradescripts.

<h3>Help</h3>
2017 TA Camille Crumpton has posted some youtube videos to help with this
lab -- <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFSAfh8OMT6qqWxJlcRrK7poAk5VcmxS>they are here.</a>

<h3>Description</h3>
<h
This program solves a puzzle.  Here you are given some number of "word dice", 
as in the picture below:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=dice.jpg></td></table></center><p>
These will be specified by strings, one per die, that contain the letters on the die.  
We won't constrain dice to have six sides -- we'll assume that a die may have any number
of sides, and that the length of the string defines the number of sides on a die.  
<p>
For example, let's assume that the above dice only have three sides each -- the sides
that you can see.  Then, the file 
<b><a href=Dice1.txt>Dice1.txt</a></b> defines the four dice pictured:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
ENG
SAA
PRR
EAE
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, you are also given a list of words, and your job is to spell the words 
on the dice so that each letter of the word is on a different die.  For example,
"RAGE" may be spelled using 'R' from the "PRR" die, 'A' from the "SAA" die, 'G' 
from the "ENG" die and 'E' from the "EAE" die.  Similarly, "SEEP" may be spelled
with 'S' from the "SAA" die, 
'E' from the "EAE" die, 
'E' from the "ENG" die and
'P' from the "PRR" die.
However, you cannot spell "PEEN", even though all the letters are there, because
you would have to use the "ENG" die for both the 'E' and 'N'.
<p>
Your job is to write the program 
<b>worddice</b>, called as follows:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
worddice dice-file word-list
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The dice file is a list of dice as above.  Each die may have any number of 
letters, and within a file, the dice may all have differing numbers of letters.
The word list is a file that contains words.  For each word in the word list file, your program
should print out:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> If the word cannot be spelled: "Cannot spell <i>word</i>".
<LI> If the word can be spelled: The order of the dice used to spell out the word, then the word.
The dice are numbered starting with zero.
</UL>

For example.

<pre>
UNIX> <b>cat Dice1.txt</b>
ENG
SAA
PRR
EAE
UNIX> <b>cat Words1.txt</b>
RAGE
SEEP
ERR
PEEN
GASP
UNIX> <b>worddice Dice1.txt Words1.txt</b>
2,1,0,3: RAGE
1,0,3,2: SEEP
Cannot spell ERR
Cannot spell PEEN
0,3,1,2: GASP
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

<h2>Organizing the program</h2>

This is an example of a bipartite matching.  For each word, set 
up a graph that matches dice to letters of the words.  For example,
here are the above dice with the word "RAGE":
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=ex1.jpg></td></table></center><p>
I've included double-edges for the duplicate letters.  Your program can eliminate these if you
want, since duplicate letters don't help you at all and just make your program run slower.
My program does that.  You want to find a <i>matching</i> of this graph that is composed 
of edges that connect two nodes, where no edge is incident to the same node.
<p>
To do this, you convert the graph into one in which network flow will solve the problem: a source
node connected to each die, and a sink node connected to each letter of the word:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=ex2.jpg></td></table></center><p>
Finding the maximum flow will discover the matching if it exists.  Here is
the flow/matching in this example:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=ex3.jpg></td></table></center><p>
Your program should use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to determine maximum flow.  The fact that
all edges have weight one makes this easier.
<p>
My program is slow for two reasons.  First, I create and destroy the graph with each
word.  It would be faster if I never deleted the source and dice nodes/edges.
Second, when I create the edges to each letter of the word, I use the <b>Find()</b>
method on the dice strings.  That is inefficient as I could instead have a 
256-element array for each die which has a 1 for each letter set in the die.  That
would speed things up.  However, I'm not doing it for lack of time.  
Maybe next semester.  That said, your program should not run more slowly than mine.

<h2>The first step -- reading the input and creating the graphs</h2>

The program <b>readorig</b> was my first step -- reading the input, creating the
network flow graph, and printing it out.  Note, my program does not have 
duplicate edges.

</pre>

It takes a little time, doesn't it? (<i>These timings are from 2008: This is on my MacBook Pro with a 2.16 Ghz processor.
The Linux box in my office (much older) takes roughly twice as long.  The cetus lab
machines take 32 seconds</i>).
Let's see if using compiler optimization helps:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>g++ -O -o worddice worddice.cpp</b>
UNIX> <b>time worddice Dice5.txt Words5.txt > /dev/null</b>
2.736u 0.050s 0:02.80 99.2%     0+0k 0+1io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Wow.  The optimized version is in the lab directory and takes 2.85 seconds on the cetus machines.
<p>
We can use our mastery of Unix tools like <b>sed</b>, <b>awk</b> and <b>grep</b> to 
answer some questions.  For example, how many words can be spelled, and how many
cannot:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>worddice Dice5.txt Words5.txt | grep ':' | wc</b>
   24400   48800  623204
UNIX> <b>worddice Dice5.txt Words5.txt | grep Cannot | wc</b>
     453    1359   10819
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Quite a high success ratio -- 24400/24953 = 97.8 percent.  What's the largest 
word that you can spell:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>worddice Dice5.txt Words5.txt | grep ':' | sed 's/,/ /g' | awk '{ print NF }' | sort -u</b>
10

What's the smallest word that you can't spell:

<h3>The Gradescript</h3>
Your output format needs to match my exactly.  However, as long as
your output is correct, you don't have to match mine.  There is a
program called <b>grader</b> in the lab directory which is used to
determine if your output is correct.
