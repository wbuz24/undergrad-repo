<H3>What you submit</h3>

This lab is broken up into three labs on Canvas:

<UL>
<LI> Lab AA: <b>dond.cpp</b>
<LI> Lab AB: <b>spellpath.cpp</b>
<LI> Lab AC: <b>spellseeker.cpp</b>
</UL>

AA and AB will be graded out of 30 points each.  AC will be graded out of 40 points.  They will
be graded independently.
<p>

I'm going to give you the descriptions of the programs first, and then after all the descriptions,
I'll give hints on how to turn the problem into a solution.

<H3>dond.cpp: Dice or No Dice</h3>

Your friend Maui Handel comes to you with an idea for a new game show (or perhaps
Vegas gambling game) called "Dice or No Dice."  The way it works is as follows.
A contestent will be given a <i>s</i>-sided die numbered from 0 to <i>s-1</i>, and a certain number of times
that they must roll that die.  Call that number <i>t</i>.  On each roll after
the first, if the contestant rolls a number that equals the previous number that they
rolled, or is one away from the number that they previously rolled, they lose.  If
they roll the die <i>t</i> times without losing, they win a certain amount of prize money.
<p>
As an extra twist, Maui says that after each roll, he can offer them a certain amount
of prize money for them to quit.  Perhaps each roll will be represented by a model wearing
glittery clothes.  He hasn't figured out those details yet.  Regardless, he would like to
be able to know the probability of success at each phase of the game so that he may set
odds.  That's where you come in.
<p>
Maui wants you to write a program called <b>dond.cpp</b> that will be called with three 
parameters:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
UNIX> dond s t last-roll
</pre></td></table></center><p>
If <b>last-roll</b> is -1, then the program should print the probability of a contestant
rolling an <b>s</b>-sided die <b>t</b> times succesfully.  Otherwise, it should assume
that the contestant has last rolled the value in <b>last-roll</b>, and we now want the
probability of rolling the die <b>t</b> more times successfully.
<p>
Your program's output should match mine, which does error-check the command line parameters.
The solution is a straightforward dynamic program with memoization if you want to structure
it that way.  You can also ditch the recursion and make it a straightforward iterative
program.  My solution was dynamic, because it required less thinking.
<p>
I won't give any hints or help here -- if you want some help, read the 
<a href=#DOND>help at the end of this file.</a>
<p>
For the grading, your program's output needs to match mine exactly on legal input.

<H3>Part AB: Spellpath and Part AC: Spellseeker</h3>

Spellseeker is a game from Neopets.  The link is
<a href=http://www.neopets.com/games/play.phtml?game_id=1157&size=regular&quality=high>here</a>,
although I'm guessing you'll need a Neopets account to look at it.  The game works
as follows.  You are given a game board, like the following:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=Grid.png width=400></td></table></center><p>

Your job is to score points by discovering long paths in the game board, where a path consists of adjacent squares whose numbers differ by one.  So, for example, the following board
shows a path of seven squares.
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><IMG src=Grid-Path.png width=400></td></table></center><p>
In the Neopets game, that dog wizard tells you that your path is ok.  In our lab, there 
is no dog wizard.  Sorry.
<p>
In the lab, we will define a grid with an input file, like
<b><a href=example.txt>example.txt</a></b>, which represents the grid above:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
213322223
332123331
331231121
133131123
131211121
231231121
-1-2-3-3-
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The format of the input file is words, where each word must contain the same
number of letters.  The first word contains the top "row" of the grid; however
the rows are skewed so that even columns are a half a square lower than odd
columns (zero-indexing, of course).  You may specify that a cell is empty
with a hyphen.  
<p>
All rows must have the same number of cells. Any cell may be blank.
Cells are not restricted to have numbers -- letters are fine too, although
we use ASCII values to determine whether two cells may be in a path together.
<p>
I have some example input files in the lab directory, plus a program 
<b>spellgen</b> that generates random input files, and a program <b>spellscreen</b>
that converts an input file into a <b>jgraph</b> file so that you can look at
it (pipe the output through <b>jgraph -P</b> to get a Postscript picture).
<b>Spellscreen</b> also does error checking for correctness.  Your program does
not have to do so.
<p>
Some example inputs are below:

We will index cells by <i>(row,column)</i>, where row zero is at the top and column zero is
at the left.  Thus, the cell at <i>(0,0)</i> in 
<b><a href=10x15.txt>10x15.txt</a></b> is <b>D</b>, the cell
<i>(0,1)</i> is <b>A</b> and the cell at <i>(1,0)</i> is <b>B</b>.
<p>
Formally, two cells are adjacent if:
<UL>
<LI> They are in the same column and their row numbers differ by one.
<LI> They are in the same row and their column numbers differ by one.
<LI> If <i>c</i> is even, then <i>(r,c)</i> is adjacent to <i>(r+1,c+1)</i> and <i>(r+1,c-1)</i>.
<LI> Similarly, if <i>c</i> is odd, then <i>(r,c)</i> is adjacent to <i>(r-1,c+1)</i> and <i>(r-1,c-1)</i>.
</UL>
Your job is to find the longest path through the cells such that adjacent nodes in the path
have values that differ by exactly one.  If there are multiple longest paths, finding just
one will do.  Below are the longest paths through the five examples above:

You are to write two programs.  The first is easier than the second.  The first is called <b>spellpath</b>.
It should read a grid on standard input and print out the length of the longest path through the grid:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>spellpath < easy-ones.txt</b>
1
UNIX> <b>spellpath < easy-3x4.txt</b>
6
UNIX> <b>spellpath < example.txt</b>
23
UNIX> <b>spellpath < 10x15.txt</b>
41
UNIX> <b>spellpath < 04x27.txt</b>
23
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

<b>Spellpath</b> should be a dynamic program, which does not have to use memoization.  This means that it
doesn't have to be too fast.  If you want help, see below.
<p>
The second program, called <b>spellseeker</b>  needs to output the path.  
It should do so by first outputting the grid, then the word "PATH",
and then the path itself.  Your output does not have to match mine, but the path must be a legal longest path.
You can check for validity with the program <b>spellchecker</b>.  So, for example:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>spellseeker < easy-ones.txt</b>
1111
1111
PATH
0 0
UNIX> <b>spellseeker < easy-3x4.txt</b>
ABBB
BBAB
-B-A
PATH
0 1
0 0
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 3
UNIX> <b>spellseeker < easy-3x4.txt | spellchecker</b>
OK - Pathlength = 6
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

<b>Spellseeker</b> should be a dynamic program that uses memoization to make it fast. 
The gradescript will test for speed, and if your program takes more than a second longer
than mine, it will kill your program and count it as wrong.  
As with <b>spellpath</b>, if you want some help, read the help
below.

<a NAME=DOND>
<h3>Help with dond.cpp</h3>
Let's look at some examples that should help you think about the solution.  In each, we'll
assume a six-sided die.  If <b>t</b> is one, then all rolls are legal.  If <b>t</b>
is one, and <b>last-roll</b> is 0 or 5, then there are four legal rolls, yielding a 
probability of 2/3.  If <b>last-roll</b> is any other value (1, 2, 3, 4), then there are only three
legal rolls, yielding a probability of 1/2.  These are all confirmed by the following
<b>dond</b> calls:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 -1</b>
1
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 0</b>
0.666667
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 1</b>
0.5
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 2</b>
0.5
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 3</b>
0.5
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 4</b>
0.5
UNIX> <b>dond 6 1 5</b>
0.666667
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

So, consider <b>t=2</b> and <b>last-roll=-1</b>.   This will be the sum of times that 
<b>t=1</b> and <b>lastroll &ne; -1</b>, divided by six.  Put another way, you have
a 1/6 probability of rolling a zero.  If you roll a zero, you have a 2/3 chance of winning.
Ditto when you roll a five.  If you roll a 1 through 4, you have a 1/2 chance of winning.
So, your probability of winning when <b>t=2</b> is 1/6 * (2/3 + 2/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2).
That value is 0.555556:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 -1</b>
0.555556
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Now consider <b>t=2</b> and <b>last-roll=0</b>.  Well, 1/6 of the time, you will roll a zero
on your next roll, and 1/6 of the time, you will roll a one.  In each of those, you lose.  However,
1/6 of the time, you will roll a 2, and your chance of winning will be "<b>dond 6 1 2</b>", which is
1/2.  The same is true when you roll a 3 or a 4.  1/6 of the time, you'll roll a 5, and your
chance of winning will be 2/3.  Therefore, if <b>t=2</b> and <b>last-roll=0</b>, your chance
of winning will be 1/6*(0 + 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2/3).
That value is 0.361111:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 0</b>
0.361111
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

You should be able to confirm all of the calls below by hand.  
For example, <b>dond 6 2 1</b> will equal 1/6*(0 + 0 + 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2/3), and 
<b>dond 6 2 2</b> will equal 1/6*(2/3 + 0 + 0 + 0/2 + 1/2 + 2/3). 

<pre>
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 1</b>
0.277778
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 2</b>
0.305556
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 3</b>
0.305556
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 4</b>
0.277778
UNIX> <b>dond 6 2 5</b>
0.361111
UNIX>
</pre>

The recursion should be getting clearer.  
<b>dond 6 3 -1</b> will equal 
1/6*(0.361111 + 0.277778 + 0.305556 + 0.305556 + 0.277778 + 0.361111) = 0.314815:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>dond 6 3 -1</b>
0.314815
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

<h3>Help with spellpath.cpp</h3>

The key to any dynamic program is to spot the recursion.  With <b>spellpath</b>, you 
will make a call to the procedure <b>MaxPathLen(row, col, grid)</b>.  This will
return the maximum path length of the longest path that starts with the cell at
<i>(row, col)</i>.  So, for example, on 
<b><a href=easy-3x4.txt>easy-3x4.txt</a></b>, 
<b>MaxPathLen(0,1)</b> will return 6, 
<b>MaxPathLen(0,0)</b> will return 5, and
<b>MaxPathLen(0,3)</b> will return 1. 
<p>
Can you spot how to write <b>MaxPathLen()</b> recursively?
I'll tell you below.
<p>
Let <i>n</i> be the cell at <i>(row, col)</i>.  Let <i>(r,c)</i> be a cell adjacent
to <i>n</i> whose value is exactly one less than or one greater than <i>n's</i> value.
Then call <b>MaxPathLen(r, c, grid-<i>n</i>)</b>, where <b>grid-<i>n</i></b> is the
grid with cell <i>n</i> removed.  Do this for all <i>(r,c)</i>.  The
return value for <b>MaxPathLen(row, col, grid)</b> will be one plus the maximum 
<b>MaxPathLen(r, c, grid-<i>n</i>)</b> for all the <i>(r,c)</i>.
<p>
Here's an example that uses the following three pictures:
<center>
<table>
<tr><td><img src=easy-3x4.jpg></td>
    <td><img src=g2.jpg></td>
    <td><img src=g3.jpg></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>g1</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g2</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g3</i></td></tr>
</table></center>
Suppose you call <b>MaxPathLen(0,0,<i>g1</i>)</b>.  You store the value of cell (0,0), which
is <b>A</b>.  Then you remove cell (0,0), from the graph, which yields <i>g2</i>.  You now
make recursive calls to 
<b>MaxPathLen(0,1,<i>g2</i>)</b>,
<b>MaxPathLen(1,0,<i>g2</i>)</b> and
<b>MaxPathLen(1,1,<i>g2</i>)</b>.  When they all finish, you will put <b>A</b> back into
cell (0,0).  You then select the call that returned the largest value, add one to it, and 
return that to your caller.
<p>
Consider those three recursive calls.
The first two will return instantly with max path lengths of one, 
because cells (0,1) and (1,0) in <i>g2</i> are only adjacent to <b>B</b>'s.  The call to 
<b>MaxPathLen(1,1,<i>g2</i>)</b>, however, will make a recursive call to
<b>MaxPathLen(1,2,<i>g3</i>)</b>.  
<p>
You should see how it goes now -- that call will eventually return 3, which means that
<b>MaxPathLen(1,1,<i>g2</i>)</b> will return 4.  Since that is the maximum of the three
recursive calls on <i>g2</i>, 
<b>MaxPathLen(0,0,<i>g1</i>)</b> will return 5.
<p>
If you call <b>MaxPathLen</b> on every cell of the original grid, the one with the maximum 
value will be the maximum length path.
<p>
You can hack this up fairly easily.  When you call 
<b>MaxPathLen(row, col, grid)</b>, save the value of <i>(row, col)</i> in a temporary
variable and set the value to '-'.  Make all of the recursive calls, and then 
set the value back to the saved value before you return to the caller.
<b>Spellpath</b> called on all of the examples above should take well less than 
a second to run.

<h3>Help with spellseeker.cpp</h3>

This one is harder.  For this, I defined a class called an <b>Answer</b>, defined as follows:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Answer {
  public:
    int length;
    int r;
    int c;
    string key;
    Answer *nexta;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>
I also have a <b>Spellseeker</b> class that contains my grid, the memoization cache, the total
rows and columns and a <b>Solve()</b> method:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class SpellSeeker {
  public:
    vector &lt;string&gt; grid;
    map &lt;string, Answer *&gt; cache;
    int total_r;
    int total_c;

    Answer *Solve(int r, int c);
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

As you can see, <b>Solve(r, c)</b> returns an <b>(Answer *)</b>.  
The <b>r</b> and <b>c</b> fields contain the <i>r</i> and <i>c</i> values of the <b>Solve()</b>
call.  <b>Length</b> is the 
maximum length path, and <b>nexta</b> contains the <b>(Answer *)</b> of the next node in the
path.  If there is no next node, <b>nexta</b> is NULL.  <b>Key</b> is a string that represents
the grid.  It is the key for my memoization cache.  
<p>
When I call <b>Solve()</b>, I first
calculate a key from the grid, then look up the key in my cache.  If it's there, then I return
its contents (which is an <b>(Answer *)</b>).  If it's not there, then I create a new
<b>(Answer *)</b> and set its <b>r</b>, <b>c</b> and <b>key</b> fields.  I then make recursive calls
as in <b>spellpath</b> above, only the recursive calls return <b>(Answer *)</b>'s instead of
lengths.  As with <b>spellpath</b>, I modify the grid before making the recursive calls (taking
the element in <i>(r,c)</i> out of the grid, and when I'm done with them, I put the element back.
I take the best of the recursive calls, and use it as my <b>nexta</b> field.  I set the length equal
to one plus the length of the <b>nexta</b> field, put the <b>(Answer *)</b> into the memoization cache and return 
it.  
<p>
Now, to create the key, you should notice that when you call <b>Solve(r,c)</b>, 
the only nodes that matter are the ones reachable
from cell <i>(r, c)</i>.  What I do is create a key that identifies those nodes and node <i>(r,c)</i>
as the starting node.  To help illustrate this, let's consider a call to <b>Solve(0,0)</b>  on 
<i>g4</i> below (I've colored node (0,0) blue).  
<center>
<table>
<tr><td><img src=sshelp0.jpg width=120></td>
    <td><img src=sshelp2.jpg width=120></td>
    <td><img src=sshelp4.jpg width=120></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>g4</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g5</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g6</i></td></tr>
</table></center>

This is going to make a recursive call to <b>Solve(1,1)</b> on <i>g5</i>, which in turn makes a 
recursive call to 
<b>Solve(0,1)</b> on <i>g6</i>.  
<p>
Now, instead, consider a call to <b>Solve(1,0)</b> on 
<i>g4</i>.  I've drawn it with cell (1,0) blue below:
<center>
<table>
<tr><td><img src=sshelp1.jpg width=120></td>
    <td><img src=sshelp3.jpg width=120></td>
    <td><img src=sshelp5.jpg width=120></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>g4</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g7</i></td>
    <td align=center><i>g8</i></td></tr>
</table></center>

This is going to make a recursive call to <b>Solve(1,1)</b> on <i>g7</i>, which in turn makes a 
recursive call to 
<b>Solve(0,1)</b> on <i>g8</i>.  
<p>
Now think about the two recursive calls to <b>Solve(0,1)</b>.  Even though graphs <i>g6</i> and <i>g8</i>
differ, the two <b>Solve(0,1)</b> calls are exactly the same and will return the same path.  This piece 
of insight helps our memoization.  The first thing that we do when we make a call to <b>Solve(r,c)</b>
is perform a DFS on the given cell to identify all the nodes reachable from <i>(r,c)</i>.  We show these
DFS results for each of the six example calls to <b>Solve()</b> above:

<center>
<table>
<tr><td align=center><img src=sshelp0-A.jpg width=120></td>
    <td align=center><img src=sshelp2-A.jpg width=120></td>

See how the two calls to <b>Solve(0,1)</b> are exactly alike.  After performing the DFS, I turn
it into a key, and that is the lookup key in my memoization cache.  The way I construct my key is
as follows: I create a string that has an entry for each cell in the
grid (empty or not).  I set all the entries to '-'.  I then set the entry for <i>(r,c)</i> to 'X'.  Then I call
the depth-first search routine that marks all nodes reachable from node <i>(r,c)</i>, and sets their entries to
'O'.  When I'm done, I have constructed my key.  
For example, the key for <b>Solve(0,1)</b> on <i>g6</i> and <i>g8</i> is:
"-XOOO---------------".  The key for <b>Solve(1,1)</b> on <i>g7</i> is
"OOOOO-X-------------".  The key for <b>Solve(0,0)</b> on <i>g4</i> is
"XOOOOOO---OO---OO---".

The memoization helps drastically in performance.  For example, calling <b>spellseeker</b> on 
<b><a href=20x20.txt>20x20.txt</a></b> takes about four tenths of a second on my Mac (this is
when <b>g++</b> is called with <b>-O2</b>).  Without memoization, it takes so long that I 
gave up and killed it before it terminated.
